[Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)

+ some pixel art and game audio sources

## Recommendations

[Fourth chapter of Psychology of programming](local/PsychologyOfProgramming.pdf.gz) the ego-less programming chapter rid me of many negative feelings surrounding the code I write.

[Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) the absolute mantra for beginner enthusiastiv SW engineer.

[A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201) is an opinionated piece on how to structure our programs worth a re-read in the future.

[How to Improve Your Social Skills](https://www.amazon.com/How-Improve-Your-Social-Skills/dp/1647396441) short and sweet piece which puts into words emotions in relation to human connection. Literally made me more assertive.

## Have-Read list

### Software Engineering

[Object-Oriented Thought Process](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Thought-Process-Developers-Library/dp/0321861272) was a let-down - too long and uninteresting.

[Art of readable code](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293) has some nice tips & tricks, but nothing life changing.

[Clean Architecture/Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164) I did not finish in favor of [Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture](https://reflectoring.io/book/) but might come back to later.
