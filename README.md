# Technical reading

A list of useful books/articles I have stumbled upon. The aim is to nerd flex and to keep track of the good stuff. To get the books also please refer to annas archive ;)

## Currently reading

[We, Programmers](https://www.amazon.com/We-Programmers-Chronicle-Coders-Robert/dp/0135344263) the first half is so far a great look into the circumstances, challenges and personal lives of earliest programmers. 

[Professional Cuda C programming](https://www.amazon.com/Professional-CUDA-Programming-John-Cheng/dp/1118739329) is very readable so far.

[Functional programming in Scala](https://www.manning.com/books/functional-programming-in-scala) the one and only red book has really opened my eyes about what is possible. Love the information density and succinct code examples.

[How To Design Programs](https://htdp.org/)

[The Pragmatic Programmer](https://pragprog.com/titles/tpp20/the-pragmatic-programmer-20th-anniversary-edition/)

[Effective Java](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch/dp/0134685997)

[Game Engines Architecture](https://www.amazon.com/Engine-Architecture-Third-Jason-Gregory/dp/1138035459/ref=sr_1_1?crid=WD33GQAMJD1&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.3oADIyb8FFbyLI2RofJkazti3CmpqIHCnpQOqACxrO_S34UlVVLDOFFdOPR2t6SgEqcTXvrRdDbUK04mXfUTtif4LY4UfhUlB0B-CIG6FYGfSyR7CisjZGgHT2Bm_QYp8lmgCg14-dMQYC9bJf_WDoK0BGcJKRaYTdqQ8KwYYVw-BxMFOAe089x4LdhNW5Ihd9tFL39Ke1KW68DaGm6e83hXXwa05TVpQiyT9vbNiYI.HMkDmL31cac_cMAINDqyi9qRyp0u5LIT12eb7GrWomo&dib_tag=se&keywords=game+engine+architecture&qid=1746699830&s=books&sprefix=game+engines%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C465&sr=1-1)

[Game Programming Patterns](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/)

+ some pixel art and game audio sources

## Standouts

[Fourth chapter of Psychology of programming](local/PsychologyOfProgramming.pdf.gz) the ego-less programming chapter rid me of many negative feelings surrounding the code I write.

[Apprenticeship Patterns](https://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382) the absolute mantra for beginner enthusiastic SW engineer.

[A Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-John-Ousterhout/dp/1732102201) is an opinionated piece on how to structure our programs, worth a re-read in the future.

[How to Improve Your Social Skills](https://www.amazon.com/How-Improve-Your-Social-Skills/dp/1647396441) short and sweet piece which puts into words emotions in relation to human connection. Literally made me more assertive.

## Have-Read list

[Effect Oriented Programming](https://effectorientedprogramming.com/) very dense, but short introduction to effect systems and their use cases.

[Effective Modern C++ 11 and 14](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1491903996) must read for truly understanding modern C++ development and its practices and benefits over older C++ versions. The book can also make me laugh and is very relatable in way the author describes his puzzlement on the complexities and weird edge cases of C++.

[Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns and Practices](https://www.amazon.com/Software-Development-Principles-Patterns-Practices/dp/0135974445] lays groundwork for modenr agile software development and has a very inspiring chapter on extreme programming.

[Dive Into Design Patterns](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/book) is a great reference for the classical design patterns and principles.

[Object-Oriented Thought Process](https://www.amazon.com/Object-Oriented-Thought-Process-Developers-Library/dp/0321861272) was a let-down - too long and uninteresting and outdated technologies.

[Art of readable code](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Readable-Code-Practical-Techniques/dp/0596802293) has some nice tips & tricks, but nothing life changing.

[Clean Architecture/Code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Architecture-Craftsmans-Software-Structure/dp/0134494164) I did not finish in favor of [Get Your Hands Dirty on Clean Architecture](https://reflectoring.io/book/) but might come back to later.
